# Welcome to my Data Analytics Projects Repository.

Hey, I’m Nirav! I am a recent Sports Technology (BEng) graduate from Loughborough University, UK, with proficiency in data collection, analysis, and visualization using Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I’m passionate about uncovering the story within data (because numbers have feelings too!) and presenting insights in impactful ways. This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills and share my projects, as well as to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
